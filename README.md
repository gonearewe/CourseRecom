# CourseRecom
A course recommendation system for learning Spark, as well as the assignment of Big Data course, NWPU. 

This project is currently under development. For FrontEnd, interface design has just finished, I've decided to use 
ElementUI and Vue to do the works. As for BackEnd, data extracting and sql processing have been tested, and I'm 
currently trying to structure the models for this system.
